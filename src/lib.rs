//! The shared core behind this repo's two front-ends.
//!
//! `review-prs` fans a repo's open PRs into one terminal tab each, to watch and
//! steer. `autoreview` reviews the same PRs headlessly through dash-p, with a
//! progress display and an exit status that means "the reviews succeeded".
//!
//! They agree on what is worth reviewing (`prlist`, `picker`, `select`) and on
//! which session a PR belongs to (`session`) because they are two binaries over
//! one library -- not two implementations kept in step by hand.
