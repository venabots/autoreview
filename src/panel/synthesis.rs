//! The one model call that turns N independent reviews into one report.
//!
//! This is the half of a panel review that is genuinely judgment: dedup,
//! severity reconciliation, spotting a panelist that misread the change, and
//! verifying a claim against the code before it reaches the reader. It runs
//! in a checkout of the reviewed code, with read access, because a
//! synthesizer that can only see the panelists' text cannot check whether any
//! of it is true.
//!
//! It is supervised exactly like a panelist. It is the same kind of process
//! with the same failure modes, and a wedge here -- after every panelist has
//! already been paid for -- is the most expensive place in the run to hang.
