pub const HELP: &str = r#"autoreview: review open PRs headlessly, with progress and a real exit status.

Usage: autoreview [--pick] [--watch[=MINUTES]] [--babysit[=MINUTES]]
                  [--focus TEXT] [--no-post] [--continue] [--jobs N]
                  [--timeout SECONDS] [--budget USD] [--log-dir DIR]
                  [--all] [--dependabot] [--stacked] [--skip-wait-for-ci] [--help]

Every NEW or UPDATED PR is reviewed by default -- the actionable ones. SEEN
PRs (nothing has changed since you last engaged) are left alone, and so is a
PR whose checks have not passed yet (see --skip-wait-for-ci).

  --pick, -p          Choose from a list instead of reviewing every one.
                      The picker shows each PR's checks in a CI column and
                      reviews what you pick, whatever the column says.
  --auto, -A          Accepted and ignored: it is the default now.
  --watch[=MIN], -w   Stay on: poll every MIN minutes for new PRs and never
                      stop (default 2, or $AUTOREVIEW_WATCH_INTERVAL). Only
                      ctrl-C ends it. Nothing to review is not a reason to
                      exit, an idle stretch is not a reason to exit, and a
                      failed refresh is retried rather than counted. With
                      --pick there is nothing to pick from if the first fetch
                      fails, so that one case still exits. A PR that
                      goes quiet and then becomes actionable again was pushed
                      to, so it gets a fresh set of passes. Use this to leave
                      a terminal reviewing all day; use --babysit for cron.
  --babysit[=MIN], -b Re-run the pass every MIN minutes (default 30, or
                      $AUTOREVIEW_BABYSIT_INTERVAL), dropping PRs as they are
                      approved or closed and picking up PRs opened or updated
                      while it ran, until none are left. A bare number is
                      minutes; 30m/1h/2d also work. Under --watch this is
                      not a sleep but a per-PR cooldown: how long a PR rests
                      after a review before it may be reviewed again.
  --focus TEXT        What the reviewers should pay attention to this run,
                      e.g. --focus "be strict about the migration". Passed to
                      the review skill, which hands it to every panelist.
                      Per-run and ad hoc: anything this repo always cares
                      about belongs in its CLAUDE.md, which panelists read
                      anyway.
  --no-post, -n       Review, but leave the PR alone: no comments, no
                      approval. The reviewer runs the skill that has no
                      posting step, so nothing is trusted to hold back. Each
                      review is written to <log-dir>/pr-N.review.md, which is
                      also written on an ordinary run. Refused alongside a
                      command override, which decides for itself what it
                      posts. The session stays resumable, so a later
                      --continue run can pick the review up and post it.
  --continue, -C      Resume this machine's earlier review session for a PR
                      (a second look at the findings) instead of reviewing it
                      from scratch. Marked RESUMABLE in the picker.
  --jobs N, -j N      Reviews to run at once (default 2, or $AUTOREVIEW_JOBS).
                      Keep it low: a panel review is itself several agents.
  --max-idle N        How many checks in a row may find nothing to do before
                      --babysit stops (default 3, or $AUTOREVIEW_MAX_IDLE).
                      Ignored under --watch, which is meant to sit idle.
                      A PR nobody is touching should not keep a process alive
                      forever, least of all one started by cron.
  --max-passes N      How often one PR may be reviewed before it is left
                      alone (default 3, or $AUTOREVIEW_MAX_PASSES). Every
                      review is activity on the PR, so an author who answers
                      makes it actionable again; this is what keeps that from
                      running for as long as the loop does. Under --watch the
                      count resets when its author pushes again.
  --timeout SECONDS   Give up on a review that runs this long (default 3600,
                      or $AUTOREVIEW_TIMEOUT; 0 disables).
  --budget USD        Cap each review's API spend (claude --max-budget-usd).
  --log-dir DIR       Where to write per-PR output (default: a temp directory,
                      printed on every run).
  --all, -a           Include PRs already marked APPROVED (default: exclude).
  --dependabot, -d    Include Dependabot PRs (default: hidden; shown dimmed).
  --stacked, -s       Review a PR even when it sits on top of another open
                      PR. By default the sweep reviews the PR underneath and
                      holds the ones above it until it lands, so a stack is
                      reviewed once, from the bottom, as it merges. Two shapes
                      are held: a PR whose base is another open PR's branch,
                      and a branch cut from another open PR's branch that
                      still says "base: main" -- GitHub then serves that PR's
                      commits as part of this one's diff, and reviewing both
                      reads the same code twice. The second is invisible in
                      the base branch, so it is found in the commits. A
                      long-lived branch is not a stack: the default branch is
                      never one, and neither is a branch that open PRs were
                      already merging into before its own PR was opened.
  --skip-wait-for-ci  Review a PR whatever its checks say. By default the
                      sweep holds a PR until the checks on its head commit
                      pass: a PR opened a minute ago has its linter still
                      running, and a review of code the author is about to
                      fix is a review wasted. Pending checks are waited for,
                      polled every 30s for up to 30m (or $AUTOREVIEW_CI_WAIT;
                      30m/1h forms). Failing checks are held until a push
                      turns them green. A --watch run never waits: it looks
                      again on its next poll, and so does the refresh between
                      --babysit passes. A PR with no checks at all is never
                      held.
  --help, -h          Show this help.
  --version, -V       Show the version.

Each PR is reviewed by a dash-p subprocess driving claude headlessly:
  dash-p --output-format json --meta-file ... --timeout ... \
    --dangerously-skip-permissions --session-id UUID -- "/auto-review N"
where UUID is derived from the repo directory plus owner/name#N, so the same PR
in this checkout always maps to the same session -- and `claude --resume UUID`
reopens it interactively later. Set $DASHP_BIN to point at a different dash-p.

The summary shows what each review concluded. RESULT is the review process
(done / timed out / failed); VERDICT is what landed on the PR, read back from
GitHub -- approved, commented, changes requested, or "nothing posted" when the
review left nothing behind, which is not a rejection. The reviewer is also
asked to report its synthesized risk, finding counts, and each panelist's
model, shown alongside the model, time and cost dash-p accounts for. On a
terminal that supports OSC 8 hyperlinks, each PR number opens the PR.

Override the reviewer via $AUTOREVIEW_AUTO_CMD for unattended runs (the default,
and --babysit), or $AUTOREVIEW_CMD for --pick runs (the PR number replaces the
first "{}", or is appended if absent):
  AUTOREVIEW_AUTO_CMD='my-review'                          (append form)
  AUTOREVIEW_AUTO_CMD='gh pr checkout {} && my-review {}'   (placeholder form)
An overridden command owns its own session handling; it receives the id as
$REVIEW_PRS_SESSION_ID and a 0/1 $REVIEW_PRS_SESSION_RESUME.

Exit status is 0 only when every review in the final pass succeeded.

To fan the same PRs into terminal tabs you can watch and steer instead, use
`review-prs`.

Your own PRs are always hidden -- this tool is for reviewing others' work.
