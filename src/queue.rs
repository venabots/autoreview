//! What the next babysit pass reviews.
//!
//! The first pass reviews what was actionable when the run started. Every pass
//! after it has two jobs the first does not: drop the PRs that are finished,
//! and pick up the ones that appeared or changed while the last pass was
//! running. A queue fixed at t=0 misses a PR opened a minute later for the
//! whole run, however long the run is.
//!
//! One rule decides membership: **the sweep says a PR is actionable now**.
//! That is not a new concept -- a review autoreview posts becomes its own
//! latest activity on the PR, so an unchanged PR goes quiet by itself and an
//! author pushing a fix makes it `UPDATED` again. Using it for staying as well
//! as for joining is what keeps an untouched PR from being re-reviewed every
//! interval until its cap runs out.
//!
//! Two things overrule the sweep, both because the sweep is a snapshot that
//! lags by up to a poll:
//!
//! - a PR that GitHub says is approved or closed is finished for the run, so a
//!   stale list cannot re-queue it on the very interval that dropped it;
//! - under `--pick`, only the PRs the user chose are eligible at all.
