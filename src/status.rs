//! What the tool is doing before it has anything to show.
//!
//! Every entry point spends the same few seconds before its first real line:
//! `gh repo view`, `gh api user`, then one GraphQL call for the PR list. On a
//! slow link that is several seconds of nothing at all, which reads as a hung
//! tool rather than a working one -- and the first thing anyone does with a
//! tool that looks hung is press ctrl-C.
//!
//! On a terminal this is one spinner line that rewrites itself and leaves
//! nothing behind, so the report still starts at the top. Anywhere else --
//! cron, CI, a pipe -- it is one plain line per step, on stderr, so a log
//! records what happened while stdout stays the report.
