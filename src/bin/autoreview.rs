// autoreview: review the current repo's open PRs headlessly -- no terminal
// tabs. Each PR is reviewed by a `dash-p` subprocess driving claude; the run
// shows live per-PR progress, prints a summary, and exits nonzero if any
// review failed.
//
// This is the sibling of `review-prs`, the other binary in this crate, which
// fans the same PRs out into one terminal tab each. The two share the library:
// same PR list, same ranking, same picker, same derived session ids.
//
// Pick this one when there is no terminal to spawn into (ssh, cron, CI), when
// the exit status has to mean "the reviews succeeded" rather than "the tabs
// opened", or when a dozen PRs would mean a dozen tabs. Pick review-prs when
// you want to watch a review happen and steer it mid-flight.
