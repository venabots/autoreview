description: >
  Run a parallel code review across multiple local CLI coding agents (codex,
  claude, opencode) and synthesize their findings. Use this skill whenever the
  user asks for a "panel review" / "panel-review", "second opinions on this
  change", "multi-agent review", "ensemble review", asks to "have multiple
  agents/LLMs review this", "cross-check this with codex/claude/etc", "fan out a
  code review", or any similar phrasing asking for independent reviews from
  outside this conversation. Each panelist runs in a fresh non-interactive
  subprocess with no shared state — that is the point. Do NOT use when the user
  just wants the current session to review code itself; use the regular
  code-reviewer agent for that. Do NOT use when the request prefixes "auto"
  onto the review ("auto review", "auto panel review", "auto-review") — the
  "auto" means the review→post→approve pipeline, which is `auto-review`
  (it calls this skill internally).

# panel-review

Spawns multiple local CLI coding agents in parallel to review the same code
change, then synthesizes their findings into one report. Each panelist runs in
its own subprocess with no shared conversation state — they only see the prompt
and the diff.

## Language

Write the synthesis in ASD-STE100 Simplified Technical English. The panelist
prompts hold the panelists to the same style, so their findings arrive this way
and stay readable when a downstream skill posts them to a PR verbatim.

- Write short sentences. Keep an instruction to 20 words. Keep a statement to 25
  words.
- Put one idea in each sentence.
- Use the active voice. Write "the retry path bypasses the guard", not "the
  guard is bypassed by the retry path".
- Use simple tenses. Write "the test fails", not "the test has been failing".
- Use one word for one meaning. Do not change "function" to "method" to
  "routine" in the same text.
- Use the simplest word that is correct. Remove jargon, idioms, metaphors, and
  figures of speech.
- Do not make a noun out of a verb. Write "when the job starts", not "at job
  initiation".
- Keep a paragraph to six sentences or fewer.

Two exceptions. Quoted panelist text stays verbatim, and the fixed labels this
skill defines (`Goal (clear):`, `Approach (questionable):`,
`Purpose (unknown):`, `Proof (missing):`, `[HIGH]`, `DECISION:`, the section
headings) stay exactly as written — the downstream skills match on them.

## What a review judges

A change is a contribution only when all four hold. Each panelist answers each
one in a header line, and the synthesis carries the answers forward:

- `Goal:` — what the change does.
- `Approach:` — whether it does that at the right layer.
- `Purpose:` — why it should exist: the problem it solves, and whether the diff
  solves that problem without a hidden cost. Correct code that hides the login
  button still fails this.
- `Proof:` — what shows it works: tests in the diff, a testing note, a run in
  the worktree. Code nobody has seen work is not known to work.

The line-level findings answer "is the code right". The four header lines answer
"should this change exist, and do we know it works". Do not let a clean findings
list stand in for the second question.

## When to use

- User says "panel review", types `/panel-review`, asks for "second opinions on
  this change", "get a panel to review this", "multi-agent review", or similar.
- User wants reviews from agents that don't share this conversation's biases or
  context.

When _not_ to use:

- User wants you (this session) to review code → use the project's code-reviewer
  agent.
- User wants a single second opinion → spawn one external CLI directly, no need
  to fan out.

## Steps

1. **Pick a target.** Map the user's phrasing to a flag:
   - "PR 27" / "pr #27" / "/panel-review pr 27" / a
     `github.com/<owner>/<repo>/pull/N` URL → `--pr <N or URL>` (requires the
     `gh` CLI).
   - "vs main" / "against develop" without a PR number → `--base <branch>`.
   - Specific SHA → `--commit <sha>`.
   - "uncommitted", "my staged changes", "my dirty work" → `--uncommitted` /
     `--staged`.
   - **Otherwise: pass no target flag at all.** The script auto-detects via
     `gh pr view` whether the current branch has an open PR. If it does and the
     working tree is clean, it switches to `--pr <N>` automatically (logged to
     stderr). If the working tree is dirty, it stays on `--uncommitted` but logs
     that the PR exists with the `--pr <N>` override hint. This is the right
     default for a branch that has a PR because reviewing against your local
     `main` (which may be stale) flags commits that are not actually in the PR.
   - Ask only if the intent is genuinely ambiguous.
   - **If the script's auto-detection rejects the current branch's PR — most
     commonly because the PR is MERGED ("branch has PR #N (state: MERGED) — not
     auto-switching"), the branch has no PR, or `gh pr view` returns
     unresolvable head metadata — and the user gave no explicit target, STOP and
     ask which branch / PR / commit they meant.** Do NOT silently fall back to
     `--base main`, `--uncommitted`, or any other target. A local branch can sit
     20+ commits ahead of the PR that originally spawned it (review-fix commits,
     post-merge cleanup, accidental WIP from another feature), so `--base main`
     quietly reviews a much larger and possibly unrelated scope than the user
     expects. The cost of one clarifying question is trivial; the cost of
     synthesizing a 6-finding report against the wrong diff is the entire skill
     invocation. When in doubt, also list nearby open PRs
     (`gh pr list --author "@me" --state open --json number,title,headRefName`)
     so the user can pick from a concrete menu rather than retype a branch name.
   - **If PR auto-detection succeeds but the script later dies with
     `--pr --checkout: failed to resolve PR url/SHA/head-repo`** (most commonly
     because `gh pr view` returned an empty `headRepository.nameWithOwner` and
     the PR head SHA isn't already in this local repo so the SHA shortcut
     couldn't kick in), the die message will quote the PR's `baseRefName` and
     suggest a concrete fallback target. Re-run with
     `--base origin/<baseRefName>` so the diff scope still matches the PR. Do
     NOT silently retry with `--uncommitted` or local `--base main` — local
     `main` may be behind `origin/main` and silently expand the review scope
     beyond what the PR contains. After the relaunch, confirm the script's first
     scope-echo heartbeat
     (`panel-review: scope vs <base>: N commits, M files changed, K insertions(+), L deletions(-)`)
     matches the PR's own commit count before trusting the synthesized findings.
2. **Pick panelists.** Every panelist is a CLI backend (codex / claude /
   opencode) driven through the `dash-p` CLI — one uniform interface that maps
   the script's generic flags onto each backend's native argv, so the script no
   longer builds per-backend command lines. `dash-p` must be on `PATH` (or set
   `DASHP_BIN`), and the underlying backend CLI must be installed too. Default:
   every backend CLI found on `PATH`. The user may name a subset, choose a model
   per reviewer, or run the same backend more than once on different models. Pass
   each reviewer as `--panelist backend[/approach][:model]` (repeatable); the
   backend is codex/claude/opencode, the optional `:model` is forwarded to that
   CLI (via `dash-p --model`), and the optional `/approach` tells that panelist
   _how_ to review (see **Review approaches** below). Examples:
   - "panel review with claude on opus-4.8" → `--panelist claude:opus-4.8`
   - "panel review with claude and two opencode reviewers, qwen and glm" →
     `--panelist claude --panelist opencode:qwen-3.7 --panelist opencode:glm-5.2`
     (bare `claude` because the user pinned no Claude model; the opencode
     reviewers are pinned because the user named their models) A bare
     `--panelist claude` (no model) uses that backend's `*_MODEL` env default.
     Each panelist gets a unique id (e.g. `opencode-qwen-3.7`,
     `claude-opus-4.8-decompose`) used in its `## <id> / <model>` section
     header, `started`/`done` heartbeats, todos, and worktree dir — so two
     reviewers on the same backend never collide. The user can also set models
     entirely from the environment via
     `PANEL_REVIEW_PANELISTS="claude:opus-4.8 opencode:qwen-3.7 opencode:glm-5.2"`.
3. **Capture optional focus.** If the user gave context ("look closely at the
   auth changes"), pass `--focus`.
4. **Mode is automatic — there is no `--checkout` decision.** PR / `--base` /
   `--commit` reviews always run worktree-isolated with write/exec permissions
   (one throwaway worktree per panelist, pinned to the target ref; passed to the
   panelist as `dash-p --cwd` with `--dangerously-skip-permissions`). Panelists
   can read code, grep callers, and run tests / build / lint commands. Network
   and GitHub-write actions are forbidden by the prompt. `--uncommitted` /
   `--staged` reviews stay local-only and read-only against the working tree
   (`dash-p --perms read-only`, which dash-p maps onto each backend — codex an OS
   sandbox, claude a write/exec tool denial list, opencode its default gating with
   no auto-approve) — no worktree, no exec. The `--checkout` flag is accepted for
   backward compat but is now a deprecated no-op; do not pass it.
5. **Run the script** (path: `skills/panel-review/panel-review.sh`). You
   **MUST** launch it as a **background Bash** (`Bash` tool with
   `run_in_background: true`) and poll progress with `BashOutput` on the
   returned `bash_id` every **10 seconds** until every panelist has emitted its
   `done (exit N)` heartbeat.

   This skill explicitly **overrides** the default harness guidance that says
   "do not poll background tasks — you'll be notified when they complete." That
   guidance is wrong for this workflow: the heartbeats and per-section streaming
   exist precisely so the coordinator can give the user live progress, and
   waiting for the single completion notification defeats that. Poll every 10
   seconds. Do not back off to 30s/60s/90s — those long sleeps are the symptom
   of obeying the wrong guidance.

   **Do NOT launch the script via the `Agent` tool / `TaskCreate` / any subagent
   mechanism.** Subagents run in a separate Claude context and there is no
   streaming-output API for in-flight subagents — the only thing the parent sees
   is the subagent's final response when it terminates. The script's stderr
   heartbeats become invisible, the per-section streaming is useless, and
   progress polling silently degrades into hacks like
   `sleep 90 && grep panel-review: tasks/<id>.output | tail` against the
   subagent's transcript file. If you catch yourself reaching for the `Agent`
   tool here, stop and use background `Bash` instead.

   **Do NOT poll by shelling out to `sleep N && grep` against any output file.**
   `BashOutput` is the only correct progress-polling mechanism for this script —
   it returns new stdout/stderr since the last call, including the stderr
   heartbeats, with no parsing required.

   Reason all of this matters: panelists run in parallel, but Codex is slow and
   dominates wall clock. Without backgrounded Bash + `BashOutput`, the call
   blocks silently for minutes and the user sees nothing.

   If you absolutely cannot use `run_in_background` (rare — usually only when
   the harness lacks `BashOutput`), run it in the foreground and pass
   `timeout: 600000` (10 min) since the default 2-minute Bash timeout will kill
   the call before Codex returns. You will lose live progress in this mode; warn
   the user.

6. **Set up live progress UX.** Right before (or right after) launching the
   script:
   - Call `TodoWrite` with one todo per chosen panelist (`Review: codex`,
     `Review: claude`, …) plus a final `Synthesize findings` todo. Initial
     statuses: the first panelist's `in_progress`, the rest `pending`. (Some
     harnesses expose this as `TaskCreate` / `TaskUpdate` instead — use
     whichever todo-list tool your environment provides.)
   - Each `BashOutput` poll: scan stderr for `panel-review: <name> started` and
     `panel-review: <name> (<model>) done (exit N)`. On a `started`, set that
     panelist's todo to `in_progress` (re-call `TodoWrite` with the updated
     list). On a `done`, set it to `completed`, post a single-line user-visible
     status that **includes the model** the panelist self-reported
     (`✓ <name> (<model>) done — N findings, top severity <SEV>` or
     `✓ <name> (<model>) — NO_FINDINGS`). A panelist that failed — non-zero exit
     **or** empty output (e.g. a provider quota / usage-limit / auth error, or a
     timeout) — is reported by the script as `done (exit N) — FAILED: <reason>`;
     surface it as `✗ <name> (<model>) FAILED (exit N): <reason>` and treat that
     panelist as having contributed **nothing** — do not count it toward
     consensus. **Immediately post that panelist's full
     `## <name> / <model> (exit N)` section to chat as soon as it appears in
     stdout**. Do not wait until every panelist is done — surfacing each section
     the moment it lands gives the user actionable findings 5–10 minutes before
     synthesis is possible. The synthesis step still adds value by deduping /
     ranking across panelists; it is not a substitute for the individual
     sections.
   - After the last `done` heartbeat, set `Synthesize findings` to
     `in_progress`, proceed to steps 7–8, then mark it `completed`.
7. **Read the script's combined output** — it prints one section per panelist
   with their raw findings, plus a tempdir path containing each panelist's
   stdout/stderr. Wait for _all_ panelists to finish before synthesizing;
   partial output is fine to _show_ the user during the wait, but consensus /
   disagreement analysis needs every panelist's verdict.
8. **Synthesize the findings** in your reply to the user. The synthesized
   summary is the primary deliverable — most readers will not scroll up to the
   per-panelist sections, so put the substance here.

   **Always carry the panelist's self-reported model into the summary.** Each
   panelist starts its output with a `Model: <id>` line; the script also exposes
   it in the `## <name> / <model> (exit N)` per-panelist section heading. Use
   the model name everywhere you would otherwise just say the panelist's name
   (e.g. `Flagged by: codex (gpt-5.5)`, or in a misinterpretation callout like
   `codex (gpt-5.5) appears to have misinterpreted the change`). If a panelist
   reported `Model: unknown`, surface that as `(unknown)` rather than silently
   omitting the model.

   **Tappable links to PR file:line.** When the target is a PR (the script's
   combined-output header shows `Target: PR #N` and emits `- PR URL: <url>`),
   wrap every `file:line` reference in the synthesized summary as a markdown
   link pointing at the PR file view, so the user can tap straight to the exact
   line on GitHub. Use the helper:

   ```bash
   bash skills/panel-review/pr-line-url.sh "$pr_url" "<file>" "<line-or-range>"
   ```

   Apply this everywhere `file:line` appears in the synthesis — every finding
   bullet under **must-fix**, **should-fix**, **polish**, plus any callout or
   **Disagreements** entry. Leave per-panelist sections (the raw
   `## <name> / <model>` blocks) untouched so the panelist's verbatim output is
   preserved. For non-PR targets, skip the wrapping — leave bare `file:line`
   text since users can typically `cmd-click` in their terminal to open it
   locally.

   Example transformation. Panelist output:

   ```md
   - [HIGH] auth/session.go:88 — TOCTOU between token check and claim load. Fix:
     take the cache lock before validating the signature.
   ```

   Synthesized entry:

   ```md
   - [HIGH]
     [auth/session.go:88](https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/27/files#diff-...R88)
     — TOCTOU between token check and claim load. Fix: take the cache lock
     before validating the signature. Flagged by 2: codex (gpt-5.5), claude
     (claude-opus-4.7)
   ```

   **Every finding MUST include `file:line` (or a named root-cause location for
   substantiated `Approach (questionable):` items, or `PR description` for a
   promoted `Purpose (unknown):`) AND a `Fix:` line.** Drop any
   panelist finding that lacks a concrete location or a suggested fix — those
   are too speculative to surface. If the issue itself is real, infer the
   location from the diff/PR yourself; if you cannot, leave it out.

   **Section structure.** The synthesis renders sections in this fixed order,
   but most sections are conditional — emit a heading only when it has content.
   The conditional behavior matters: blank sections, "none" placeholders, and
   ceremonial labels make the report feel robotic and bury the real signal.
   - `### Overview` — always.
   - `### Risk` — always.
   - **Misinterpretation callout** — only when a panelist's stated goal
     disagrees with the actual diff. Renders as a
     `**Misinterpretation detected:** …` block between `### Risk` and the next
     section. No callout when nothing's wrong.
   - `### Goal check` — only when goals are contested (mixed clear/unclear,
     panelists describe different goals, or any panelist tagged
     `(clear, contradicts description)`). When all agree, omit the section
     entirely; the Overview lead already states the goal.
   - `### Approach check` — only when at least one panelist flagged
     `Approach (questionable):` with all three evidence components present and
     you verified them. When all-sound (or all under-evidenced), omit the
     section; `Approach: sound.` appears inline at the end of `### Risk`.
   - `### Purpose check` — only when a panelist tagged
     `Purpose (stated, not served):` or `Purpose (unknown):` and you verified
     it, or when panelists disagree on the purpose. When every panelist tagged
     `(stated, served)` or `(inferred)` with the same reason, omit the section;
     the Overview lead already states the purpose.
   - `### Proof check` — only when a panelist tagged `Proof (missing):` on a
     change that alters behavior and you verified it. When every panelist
     tagged `(shown)` or `(not needed)`, omit the section; `Proof: <evidence>.`
     appears inline at the end of `### Risk`.
   - `### must-fix` — CRITICAL/HIGH findings. Omit if empty.
   - `### should-fix` — MEDIUM findings. Omit if empty.
   - `### polish` — LOW findings. Omit if empty.
   - `### Disagreements` — only when panelists actually contradict each other on
     a finding (one flags it, another examined the same code and said it's fine;
     or verification falsified a raised finding). Omit when there's nothing to
     surface — do NOT emit a "Disagreements: none." line.
   - `DECISION: <verdict>` — always, and always the last line. See
     **The decision line** below.

   ### The decision line

   The synthesis ends with one line, on its own, and nothing after it except a
   machine trailer the caller's system prompt asks for:

   ```
   DECISION: Approve
   ```

   The verdict is one of three fixed strings, and it follows from the buckets
   and the Risk above, not from a fresh judgment. Apply the rules in order;
   the first that matches wins, so every synthesis has exactly one verdict:
   1. `DECISION: Request changes` — `### must-fix` has an entry. A promoted
      `Approach`, `Purpose`, or `Proof` flag already sits in a bucket, so it
      needs no rule of its own.
   2. `DECISION: Comment` — `### should-fix` has an entry, or Risk is HIGH or
      CRITICAL. Risk can be HIGH with no finding at all, from the area touched
      or from panelists that disagreed on the goal; that is still not an
      approval.
   3. `DECISION: Approve` — everything else: no finding, or polish only, with
      Risk LOW or MEDIUM.

   This skill posts nothing, so the line says what the review recommends, not
   what happened on the PR. Put no reason on the line; the sections above are
   the reason. A reader who scrolls to the end gets the answer, and a caller
   that only reads the last line gets the same one.

   ### Overview

   Lead the section with one **target line** before either prose paragraph, so
   the user can spot a wrong-target review the instant they scan the output.
   Render verbatim as a bold label + the target string, no other prose on the
   line. Shapes by mode:
   - PR mode: `**Reviewing:** PR #<N> on <head-branch> — "<PR title>".`
   - `--base`:
     `**Reviewing:** <N> commits on <current-branch> vs <base-branch>.`
   - `--commit`: `**Reviewing:** commit <short-sha> ("<commit subject>").`
   - `--uncommitted` / `--staged`:
     `**Reviewing:** uncommitted changes on <current-branch>.`

   This is non-optional even when the target seems obvious — the failure mode it
   prevents is silent scope drift (e.g. `--base main` quietly reviewing 20+
   commits when the user expected a 2-commit feature branch). After the target
   line, leave a blank line and write the two paragraphs below.

   **Paragraph 1: lead with the goal and the purpose (uncontested case only).**
   When all panelists agreed on a clear goal and a served or inferred purpose
   (no goal-check or purpose-check section will be emitted), open with both in
   plain human language — one or two sentences, no `Goal:` / `Purpose:` label,
   no "all panelists agree" suffix. Say what the change does and the problem it
   solves. The absence of a goal-check / purpose-check section below is the
   implicit signal that everyone agreed. Example:

   ```md
   Stand up the @bank/evm package as the foundation for future send-saga work —
   viem-backed primitives for the EVM transaction lifecycle. Today each saga
   re-implements nonce and receipt handling; this gives them one shared copy.
   ```

   If the goal or the purpose is contested (any case that would trigger a
   goal-check or purpose-check section per the conditional rules above), **skip
   paragraph 1 entirely**. The reader's signal is the presence of that section
   further down; absence of a lead in Overview lines up with that.

   **Paragraph 2: factual scope.** Two to four sentences for a human who has not
   seen the diff. State factually what files / areas changed, the kind of change
   (refactor, bug fix, new feature, config, dep bump, infra, …), and rough scope
   (lines added/removed, files touched). For PR mode pull this from
   `gh pr view --json files` and the diff; for non-PR targets infer from the
   diff. Do **not** editorialize — evaluation lives in `### Risk` and the
   finding buckets.

   ### Risk

   One of `LOW` / `MEDIUM` / `HIGH` / `CRITICAL`, then a one-sentence
   justification that points at observable signals (multi-panelist findings,
   area touched, scope), not vibes. When every panelist tagged
   `Approach (sound):` and there are no questionable claims to surface, append
   `Approach: sound.` as a second sentence so the verdict stays visible without
   a separate section. When a `### Approach check` section will be emitted
   below, omit the inline `Approach:` line — the section carries the detail.
   Do the same for proof: when no `### Proof check` section will be emitted,
   append `Proof: <the evidence, in a few words>.` (for example
   `Proof: new unit tests in receipts.test.ts; suite green in the worktree.` or
   `Proof: not needed, docs only.`). When a `### Proof check` section will be
   emitted, omit the inline line.

   Rubric:
   - **LOW** — docs / tests / formatting / non-load-bearing refactor. No
     multi-panelist findings. No HIGH/CRITICAL findings. All panelists agreed on
     the goal. All panelists tagged `Approach (sound):`. No auth / payments /
     migrations / cryptography touched. A `Purpose (unknown):` or a
     `Proof (missing):` does **not** by itself lift a change out of this bucket:
     a thin description and an untested change are reported, not blocked.
   - **MEDIUM** — touches business logic or non-trivial code paths. Findings
     exist but are fixable. No CRITICAL findings. Goal was clear or only mildly
     divergent across panelists. No verified `Approach (questionable):`.
   - **HIGH** — any of:
     - a verified HIGH finding raised by 2+ panelists;
     - a verified `Approach (questionable):` flag (the change is fixing the
       wrong layer — even a correct implementation is short-term relief at the
       cost of future bugs);
     - a verified `Purpose (stated, not served):` flag (the diff does not do
       what the description says, or does it at a cost the description hides);
     - a verified `Proof (missing):` on a change that touches auth, session
       handling, payments, schema migrations, crypto, or production infra;
     - the change touches auth, session handling, payments, schema migrations,
       crypto, or production infra;
     - panelists disagreed substantially on what the change does;
     - the diff is unusually large (>500 lines) AND lacks a clear goal or a
       stated purpose.
   - **CRITICAL** — any verified CRITICAL finding (a bug in the change that
     would break production on merge, or a known data-loss / security-bypass /
     credential-leak path introduced) escalates the whole change to this bucket
     regardless of the area touched. A verified `Approach (questionable):` that
     ALSO independently satisfies another HIGH trigger (e.g. wrong-layer fix in
     auth/payments code) lands here too.

   This is the single source of truth for severity assignment. The
   `### Approach check` section promotes substantiated `(questionable):` flags
   into `### must-fix` as HIGH-severity findings — it does not separately mutate
   Risk. Risk is whatever the rubric above evaluates to.

   Examples:
   - `Risk: CRITICAL — codex flagged a verified timing-attack vulnerability in session-token validation at auth/session.go:88.`
   - `Risk: LOW — docs-only change to the panel-review skill instructions; no consensus findings. Approach: sound.`

   **Misinterpretation check (mandatory; emits a callout only when triggered).**
   Beyond collating the panelists' `Goal:` tags, independently verify that each
   panelist's stated goal is actually consistent with what the diff does. A
   panelist can confidently tag itself `Goal (clear)` while having misread the
   change — that produces confidently-wrong findings further down. For each
   panelist:
   1. Read the diff yourself (or the PR via `gh pr view --json files,title,body`
      and `gh pr diff <ref>`) to form an independent understanding of intent.
   2. Compare your read against the panelist's `Goal:` line.
   3. If they disagree, emit a callout between `### Risk` and the next section:

      ```md
      **Misinterpretation detected:** codex (gpt-5) appears to have
      misinterpreted the change. It said "<goal>" but the diff actually
      <what it really does>. Treat its findings below with skepticism — verify
      each one against the code before acting on it.
      ```

   4. Apply step 9's verification more aggressively to that panelist's findings:
      drop any whose substance depends on the misread intent; keep only findings
      that still hold independent of the panelist's mistaken framing.

   No misinterpretation → no callout. Do NOT emit a "no misinterpretations
   detected" placeholder. Do not assume agreement among panelists implies
   correctness — two panelists can share a misread (especially if the diff is
   unusual or the description is misleading). When in doubt, your own read of
   the diff is the tiebreaker.

   ### Goal check (only when goals contested)

   Each panelist starts its output with a `Goal:` line tagged `(clear)`,
   `(clear, matches description)`, `(clear, contradicts description)`, or
   `(unclear)`. Emit this section only when at least one of these holds:
   - **Mixed clear / unclear** — surface the divergence. Quote what the unclear
     panelist(s) said was ambiguous. The change being non-self-explanatory is
     itself a HIGH-severity finding; add it to `### must-fix`.
   - **Panelists described different goals** — the change is likely doing
     several things at once or is genuinely confusing. Quote each panelist's
     goal verbatim so the user can decide whether to split the PR.
   - **Any panelist returned `Goal (clear, contradicts description):`** — quote
     what they said the actual goal is vs. what the description claims.
     MEDIUM/HIGH worth raising even if no one else flagged it.

   When all panelists agreed on a clear goal, omit this section entirely — the
   Overview lead already states the goal in plain language.

   ### Approach check (only when questionable verified)

   Each panelist outputs an `Approach:` line immediately after `Goal:`, tagged
   `(sound)` or `(questionable)`. This block asks whether the change is being
   made at the right layer — a UI fix for a server bug, a client validator for a
   missing DB constraint, etc.

   Emit this section only when one of these holds:
   - **One or more `Approach (questionable):` with all three evidence components
     present** (root cause named, root-cause fix location specified, reason the
     current change is symptomatic), and you verified them against the code.
     Quote the substantiated claim:

     ```md
     - questionable (raised by: codex (gpt-5.5)): the diff adds client-side
       validation in `web/src/forms/order.tsx:42`, but the root cause is that
       the `orders` table allows duplicate `(user_id, idempotency_key)` rows.
       Real fix lives in a migration on `orders`. This is the third caller to
       re-implement the same validation — grep shows two prior copies in
       `web/src/forms/`.
     ```

     Also promote this finding into `### must-fix` as a HIGH-severity entry (use
     the named root-cause location in place of `file:line`).

   - **Panelists disagree (one sound, another questionable)** — surface both
     verdicts. The questionable side wins by default if its three evidence
     components hold up under your own verification (apply step 9); if the
     evidence doesn't hold, drop the questionable claim and note the
     falsification under `### Disagreements`.

   Otherwise — all-sound, or questionable claims dropped because evidence didn't
   hold — omit this section. `Approach: sound.` appears inline at the end of
   `### Risk` instead.

   **Verify before promoting (mandatory).** Treat a `questionable` flag like any
   unique CRITICAL/HIGH claim — open the named root-cause location, confirm the
   bug actually recurs there or that the constraint is actually missing, and
   only then surface it. A wrong `Approach (questionable):` is worse than a
   missed one because it derails the entire review toward a phantom redesign.

   ### Purpose check (only when purpose is missing, not served, or contested)

   Each panelist outputs a `Purpose:` line after `Approach:`, tagged
   `(stated, served)`, `(stated, not served)`, `(inferred)`, or `(unknown)`.
   This block asks why the change should exist and whether the diff serves that
   reason. Working code with no reason to exist is not a contribution.

   Emit this section only when one of these holds:
   - **A verified `Purpose (stated, not served):`.** Read the description and
     the diff yourself. Confirm the gap the panelist names: the diff does not
     solve the stated problem, solves a different one, or solves it at a cost
     the description hides. Quote the claim and the location:

     ```md
     - not served (raised by: claude (claude-opus-4.7)): the body says "fix the
       header overlap on mobile", but `web/src/layout/header.tsx:61` removes the
       login button from the mobile breakpoint instead of moving it. The
       overlap is gone because the button is gone.
     ```

     Promote this into `### must-fix` as a HIGH-severity entry at the named
     `file:line`.

   - **A verified `Purpose (unknown):` on a non-trivial change.** Read the
     description yourself. If it states no problem and you cannot infer one
     from the diff either, quote what the panelist said a reader would need.
     Promote this into `### polish` as a LOW-severity entry (see the
     description-anchored shape under **Findings buckets**). A description a
     reader cannot judge the change against is worth saying out loud; it is not
     a reason to hold the merge. If you can infer the purpose with confidence,
     drop the flag and state the purpose in the Overview lead instead; note
     under `### Disagreements` that the panelist could not.

   - **Panelists name different purposes.** Quote each verbatim. Either the
     description is unclear or the change does more than one thing; the user
     decides.

   Otherwise — all served or inferred, with one shared reason — omit this
   section. The Overview lead carries the purpose.

   ### Proof check (only when proof is missing and verified)

   Each panelist outputs a `Proof:` line after `Purpose:`, tagged `(shown)`,
   `(missing)`, or `(not needed)`. This block asks what shows the change works.

   Emit this section only when at least one panelist tagged `Proof (missing):`
   on a change that alters behavior, and you verified it: open the diff, look
   for tests that exercise the changed behavior, and read the description's
   testing notes. A panelist in read-only mode can miss a testing note in the
   PR body; a panelist in worktree mode can run a green suite that never touches
   the changed lines. Your own read is the tiebreaker.

   Quote the unproven behavior with its location:

   ```md
   - missing (raised by 2: codex (gpt-5.5), claude (claude-opus-4.7)): the retry
     path in `packages/evm/src/broadcast.ts:140-172` is new behavior; no test
     exercises it and the PR body has no testing section.
   ```

   Promote this into `### polish` as a LOW-severity entry at the `file:line` of
   the unproven behavior — **unless** that behavior is in auth, session
   handling, payments, schema migrations, crypto, or production infra, which
   goes into `### must-fix` as HIGH. Everywhere else an untested change is
   reported and left to the author's judgment; only the sensitive surfaces hold
   the merge. The `Fix:` line names the test to write or the evidence to add,
   not "add tests".

   When every panelist tagged `(shown)` or `(not needed)`, or the `(missing)`
   claims did not hold, omit this section. `Proof: <evidence>.` appears inline
   at the end of `### Risk` instead.

   ### Findings buckets (must-fix / should-fix / polish)

   The three severity buckets ARE the findings list — there are no separate
   "Consensus" or "Unique" sections. Bucketing is by severity:
   - `### must-fix` — CRITICAL and HIGH findings.
   - `### should-fix` — MEDIUM findings.
   - `### polish` — LOW findings.

   Omit any bucket that has no entries — no empty headings, no "none" lines.

   **Per-finding shape (CRITICAL / HIGH / MEDIUM):**

   ```md
   - [SEVERITY] file:line — one-sentence issue. Fix: one-sentence suggested
     change. Flagged by: codex (gpt-5.5)
   ```

   When 2+ panelists raised the same finding, list every panelist on the
   `Flagged by:` line and prefix with the count. The count is the implicit
   consensus signal — no separate "CONSENSUS" badge, no separate section:

   ```md
   - [MEDIUM] packages/evm/src/receipts.ts:130 + packages/evm/src/errors.ts:364
     — `RETRYABLE_RPC_CODES` duplicated verbatim across two files. Fix: export
     from errors.ts and import in receipts.ts. Flagged by 2: claude
     (claude-opus-4.7), opencode (qwen3.6-plus)
   ```

   When panelists assigned different severities to the same finding, use the
   higher and add a short note inline on the `Flagged by:` line:

   ```md
   Flagged by 2: claude (claude-opus-4.7) [LOW], opencode (qwen3.6-plus)
   [MEDIUM] — using higher.
   ```

   **Per-finding shape (LOW).** Collapse to a single line. LOW items rarely need
   a sentence of repair guidance; the issue description and `Flagged by:` are
   enough:

   ```md
   - [LOW] packages/evm/src/broadcast.ts:299-307 — `stripSerialized` is
     unreachable post-`sanitizeMessage`. Flagged by: claude (claude-opus-4.7)
   ```

   If a LOW finding genuinely needs a `Fix:` line (e.g. the change is
   non-obvious), keep the two-line shape — but ask yourself whether it belongs
   in `### should-fix` instead.

   **Per-finding shape (substantiated `Approach (questionable):`).** Lives under
   `### must-fix` as a HIGH-severity entry. Use the named root-cause location in
   place of `file:line`:

   ```md
   - [HIGH] root cause: `orders` table allows duplicate
     `(user_id, idempotency_key)` rows — the diff adds client-side validation in
     `web/src/forms/order.tsx:42` that papers over it; this is the third caller
     to re-implement the same validation. Fix: add a unique constraint on
     `orders(user_id, idempotency_key)` (or equivalent migration), then drop the
     per-caller client validators. Flagged by: codex (gpt-5.5)
   ```

   Put the Approach entry at the top of `### must-fix` — if the approach is
   wrong, the per-line findings below may not survive the rework. A promoted
   `Purpose (stated, not served):` entry goes directly below it, at its
   `file:line`, for the same reason.

   **Per-finding shape (promoted `Purpose (unknown):`).** Lives under
   `### polish` as a LOW-severity entry. The location is the PR description (or
   the commit message for non-PR targets), written as `PR description` in place
   of `file:line`; downstream skills post it as a top-level PR comment rather
   than an inline one:

   ```md
   - [LOW] PR description — states no problem this change solves; the diff
     rewrites `packages/evm/src/nonce.ts` and a reader cannot tell what was
     wrong before. Fix: add one or two sentences on the problem and how a
     reviewer can see it is fixed. Flagged by: codex (gpt-5.5)
   ```

   **Per-finding shape (promoted `Proof (missing):`).** Lives under `### polish`
   (LOW), or `### must-fix` (HIGH) when the unproven behavior is in auth,
   session handling, payments, schema migrations, crypto, or production infra,
   at the `file:line` of that behavior. The `Fix:` line names the specific test
   or evidence:

   ```md
   - [LOW] packages/evm/src/broadcast.ts:140-172 — the new retry path has no
     test and the PR body has no testing note. Fix: add a test that fails the
     first send with a retryable code and asserts one retry, then note the run
     in the PR body. Flagged by 2: codex (gpt-5.5), claude (claude-opus-4.7)
   ```

   **Order within a bucket.** Within a severity, items raised by more panelists
   go first (consensus first), then single-flag items. Within a tie, group by
   file path so related findings sit together. CRITICAL above HIGH inside
   `### must-fix`.

   **Dedup logic.** Two panelists raised the "same" finding when they cite the
   same `file:line` (or overlapping ranges) AND the underlying claim is
   substantively the same. A different fix suggestion at the same location is
   still consensus on the bug; either pick the better fix and note the other
   inline, or record both on the `Fix:` line as alternatives. A different bug at
   the same line is NOT consensus — list as two separate findings.

   ### Disagreements (only when panelists actually contradict)

   Emit this section only when panelists disagree on whether a piece of code is
   buggy at all (one flags it, another examined the same code and said it's
   fine), or when verification falsified a raised finding. Omit the heading when
   there is nothing to surface — do NOT emit a "Disagreements: none." line.

   Surface each disagreement with `file:line` for the disputed code. Do not pick
   a side unless step 9 verification resolves it; lay out both positions.
   Severity-only splits (e.g. claude LOW vs opencode MEDIUM on the same issue)
   do NOT belong here — those are noted inline on the finding's `Flagged by:`
   line.

9. **Verify questionable findings before surfacing them.** A panelist's finding
   is questionable when any of these holds:
   - It is unique to one panelist AND its severity is CRITICAL/HIGH (high-impact
     claim with no second opinion).
   - The `Fix:` line does not obviously address the stated issue.
   - The line number is suspicious (referenced line is unchanged in the diff, or
     out of range for the file).
   - Two panelists disagree on whether the same code is buggy.
   - The panelist's reasoning depends on context outside the diff (caller
     behavior, framework guarantees, downstream consumers) that they did not
     actually verify.

   For each questionable finding, open the actual diff/file (use `gh pr diff`,
   `gh api .../files`, or `Read` against the local checkout) and confirm the bug
   exists as described before surfacing it. If verification disproves the
   finding, drop it and note the correction in `### Disagreements`. If
   verification sharpens the finding (e.g., you find the right line number),
   promote the corrected version into the summary. Never repeat a panelist claim
   into the summary that you could have falsified in 30 seconds with a Read tool
   call.

10. **Don't paraphrase or invent.** Surface what the panelists actually said. If
    a panelist returned `NO_FINDINGS`, note it; don't drop the panelist from the
    report. You may correct a panelist's line number if it is clearly off (e.g.,
    they cited a pre-image line and the file is now post-image), but never
    invent a line number to satisfy the format. The verification step in step 9
    is the _only_ license to rewrite a finding's substance — and only when you
    have actually checked the code.

## Review approaches

Every panelist is a CLI subprocess that reads the diff and emits findings in the
standard shape — so synthesis (steps 7–10) is panelist-agnostic and never
changes when you add one. What _can_ vary is **how** a panelist reviews: an
**approach** is a block of extra instructions appended to that panelist's
prompt. The default (empty) approach is a standard whole-diff review.

Select an approach two ways:

- **Per panelist:** `--panelist backend[/approach][:model]` — that one panelist
  reviews using the approach (e.g. `--panelist claude/decompose:opus-4.8`).
- **Run default:** `--approach <name>` — applies to every panelist that didn't
  set its own (e.g. `--approach decompose` makes the whole auto-detected panel
  use it). A per-panelist `/approach` overrides the run default.

Either way the panelist still runs as a normal CLI backend and its findings fold
into synthesis like any other — a `decompose` panelist's findings are just
another `Flagged by:` voice (unique if it alone caught something, consensus if a
holistic panelist caught it too). No coordinator, no subagent fan-out.

Current approaches:

- **`decompose`** — improves recall on large diffs: the panelist chunks the
  changed files into coherent groups (sensitive surfaces isolated) and reviews
  each closely, then does a dedicated cross-boundary seam pass. The work happens
  inside that one CLI subprocess. Self-scales down on small diffs.

**To add an approach:** drop a `prompts/approaches/<name>.md` fragment (extra
"how to review" instructions, appended after the base prompt). It is valid
immediately — the script accepts `--approach <name>` / `/<name>` as soon as the
file exists, and synthesis is unchanged because the panelist still emits the
standard finding shape.

## Reference

CLI flags, env vars, and examples: run
`bash skills/panel-review/panel-review.sh --help`.

Every panelist is spawned as `dash-p -H <backend> ...`. `dash-p` is the
uniform driver over claude / codex / opencode: the script passes generic flags
(`-H`, `--model`, `--cwd`, `--perms`, `--dangerously-skip-permissions`,
`--timeout`) and `dash-p` translates them into each CLI's native argv. It must be
on `PATH` (install with `brew install venabots/tap/dash-p`; override the binary
with `DASHP_BIN`); override the underlying claude binary with `dash-p`'s own
`DASHP_CLAUDE_BIN`.

The script handles two cases internally:

- **Local targets** (`--uncommitted` / `--staged`): builds the diff with `git`,
  embeds it in the prompt, runs panelists read-only against the working tree
  (`dash-p --perms read-only`).
- **Committed targets** (`--pr` / `--base` / `--commit`): one throwaway git
  worktree per panelist pinned to the target ref (passed as `dash-p --cwd`),
  panelists run with `--dangerously-skip-permissions` so they can grep callers,
  run tests, and install dev deps. PR targets additionally use an
  instruction-style prompt where panelists fetch the diff and existing review
  comments via `gh` themselves (live remote state — no stale-base drift, no
  diff-size cap).

Other behavior worth knowing:

- If a panelist times out or fails, the script keeps the others' output and
  exits 2. Surface the failure in the synthesized report rather than dropping
  the panelist.
- The combined output references a tempdir (`/tmp/panel-review-XXXXXX/`) — read
  any panelist's full stdout/stderr from there if the inline excerpt is not
  enough.
- Panelists pick up the project's `AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` — intentional, but
  worth knowing if those files would bias the review.
