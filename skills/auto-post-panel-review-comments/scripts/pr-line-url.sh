# Compute a GitHub PR file-line anchor URL for a given path:line, so this skill
# can emit tappable deep-links in the disposition report, in Linear ticket
# bodies, and in the review body (see SKILL.md "Deep-links").
#
# The logic below is duplicated in
# skills/post-panel-review-comments/scripts/pr-line-url.sh (each skill installs
# standalone, so the script is copied rather than shared) — keep the two in sync.
#
# GitHub's per-file PR diff anchor is `diff-<sha256-of-relative-path>`. Append
# `R<n>` for the new (right-side) line in the diff, or `L<n>` for the old/left
# side. This script emits the right-side anchor, which is what reviewers want
# when pointing at code introduced or modified by the PR.
#
# If GitHub ever changes the anchor format, the only thing to update is the
# final printf below — the SHA-256-of-path computation is general.
#
# Usage:
#   pr-line-url.sh <pr-url> <file-path> <line-or-range>
#
# Examples:
#   pr-line-url.sh https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/27 src/app.ts 42
#   pr-line-url.sh https://github.com/owner/repo/pull/27 src/app.ts 42-58
#
# Outputs the URL to stdout. Exits 1 on usage or environment errors.
